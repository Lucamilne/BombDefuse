# BombDefuse

The Bomb Defusal RGB Game is an evolution of the classic statis webpage rite of passage that is the RGB color game.

You must click on the correct wire as described by the header e.g. Cut the RGB(255, 255, 255) wire!

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
