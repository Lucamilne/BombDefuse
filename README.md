# BombDefuse

The Bomb Defusal RGB Game is my unique interpretation of the RGB color game, a static webpage rite of passage. It's primary purpose is to show a more advanced understanding of CSS and Javascript than is typically required.

You must click on the correct wire as described by the header e.g. Cut the RGB(255, 255, 255) wire!

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
