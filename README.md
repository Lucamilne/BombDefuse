# BombDefuse

The Bomb Defusal RGB Game is my unique interpretation of the RGB color game, a static webpage rite of passage. It's primary purpose is to show a more advanced understanding of CSS and Javascript than is typically required.

You must click on the correct wire as described by the header e.g. Cut the RGB(255, 255, 255) wire!

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

Some additional features that I've added that isn't typical of the standard RGB color game:

-Interactivity with the squares (or in this case, wires) is limited once the correct wire is picked.
-LED light indicates 3 states of the bomb, idle, detonation sequence initiated and defused. 
-Buttons on the bomb are interactive with the display. This is purely cosmetic and has no impact on the game mechanics. 
-Bomb is created entirely out of CSS
-Added a hard difficulty expanding the total wires to 9. Typical the RGB color game only has two difficulties displaying 3 and 6 squares.
